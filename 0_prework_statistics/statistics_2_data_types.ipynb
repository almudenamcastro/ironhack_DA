To ensure accuracy, let's compare these results with our previous analysis and examine any differences.\n","\n","Have in mind that:\n","\n","- **Numbers can indicate categories**: The presence of numbers in a column does not necessarily mean it represents a numerical variable. We can use the `nunique()` method to determine the number of unique values in a column. If the number of unique values is small, it suggests that the variable is categorical, even if it is represented as a number. It is crucial to understand the variable's meaning and context to correctly interpret its data type.\n","\n","- **Errors in data can affect data types**: In certain cases, errors or inconsistencies in the data can lead to a numerical variable being classified as an object data type. For example, if an \"Age\" column contains a space or a value like \"h25\", it would be stored as an object data type instead of an int or float. This can be misleading and may lead to confusion if the variable is incorrectly assumed to be categorical.\n","\n","Therefore, it is essential to consider the unique values, data information, and the intended meaning of a variable when determining its data type, rather than solely relying on the data type itself."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.13"},"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"1UVZveOGVYijnNo3tPI1SY5IqOXMsdG-v","timestamp":1724327423949}]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
