Here are some basic elements of pseudocode:\n","\n","- Statements: Each line of pseudocode represents a specific action or instruction, written in plain language. For example, \"Print 'Hello, world!'\" or \"Set x to 5.\"\n","\n","- Variables: Variables are used to store and manipulate data in pseudocode. They are usually represented by names and can be assigned values or used in expressions. For example, \"Set x to 5\" or \"total = x + y.\"\n","\n","- Input/Output: Pseudocode often includes instructions for reading input from the user or displaying output. For example, \"Read user input\" or \"Display result.\"\n","\n","- Control Structures: Pseudocode includes control structures like if-else statements, loops, and function definitions. These control structures help in making decisions and repeating actions. For example, \"If x is greater than 10, then do this\" or \"Repeat until condition is true.\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xIYXo5FKGuTj"},"source":["### Writing Pseudocode\n","When writing pseudocode, focus on expressing the logic of the algorithm in a clear and understandable manner. Here are some tips to help you get started:\n","- Start with a clear problem statement: Understand the problem you are trying to solve and clearly define the inputs, outputs, and expected behavior.\n","\n","- Break down the problem into smaller steps: Identify the key actions or operations required to solve the problem and outline them step by step.\n","\n","- Use meaningful names: Choose descriptive names for variables and actions to improve readability and understanding.\n","\n","- Keep it simple: Pseudocode should be concise and easy to follow. Avoid unnecessary details and focus on the main steps.\n","\n","- Indentation: Use indentation to represent code blocks within control structures, just like in actual programming languages. This helps visualize the structure and hierarchy of the algorithm.\n","\n","- Test your pseudocode: Before translating pseudocode into actual code, mentally walk through the steps to see if they make sense and cover all necessary operations.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"YiFFUgPlGuTj"},"source":["One way to do it is to write on a piece of paper each step you would like to do **even the most obvious step** and then figure out how to write the corresponding code.\n","\n","- Example 1: For every element in this list I want to compute the square of each element.\n","\n","    Look at the sentence, there are at least two keywords: **FOR -> FOR LOOP**, and **list -> list variable**\n","\n","- Example 2: As long as the runner hasn't reached the finish line keep running.\n","\n","    Look at the sentence, there is a condition here for stop. Therefore you should use a **WHILE LOOP**. To make sure the code will run, you need to use a variable to store the state of the condition at the beginning.

This will remove any spaces from the left side of the input string. Example: input_string = input_string.lstrip().

Example: input_string = input_string.lstrip(\"symbol_to_remove\")*\n","\n","    - *To replace a specific character or substring within a string, you can use the `replace()` method.
